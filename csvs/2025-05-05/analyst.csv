ANGELONE,"Angel One Limited demonstrates strong growth potential in the short to mid-term, supported by its robust diversification strategy and focus on technology-driven solutions. The company reported a 21.8% YoY revenue growth to ₹5,172 Cr, driven by client acquisition and expansion into Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities, which now account for 88% of new clients. Despite a QoQ revenue decline of 17.26% due to softer market conditions and regulatory impacts, Angel One's operating profit margin of 39% and net profit margin of 23.5% underscore its operational efficiency. The management's emphasis on leveraging AI/ML technology, enhancing its NXT platform, and expanding into credit, insurance, and asset management positions the company well for sustained growth.

The company’s Q3 FY25 performance highlights a 9.17% YoY revenue growth and a 59% increase in PBT, driven by robust feed division sales and improved profitability from softening raw material costs. Shrimp feed exports and diversification into pet food and fish feed markets are expected to sustain growth, with the pet food segment already gaining traction under the Avant Furst brand. Additionally, the company’s focus on value-added shrimp products and expansion into global markets like Japan, Korea, and the EU positions it well to mitigate challenges such as U.S. countervailing duties.
